# Multi-Modal-Route-Finding-System

This project combines text-based and image-based route finding functionalities into a single Streamlit application.

## Overview

The Combined Route Finder allows users to find routes between locations using text inputs or by uploading images with maps. It integrates functionalities from two separate Streamlit applications: one for text-based route finding and another for image-based route finding.

## Features

- Text-based route finding: Users can input starting and goal locations as text and find the route between them.

- Image-based route finding: Users can upload images with maps and select start and end points on the map to find the route.
  Currently it works only on a few maps. **Development in progress** 

- Interactive UI: The application provides an interactive user interface with map visualization and route statistics.
